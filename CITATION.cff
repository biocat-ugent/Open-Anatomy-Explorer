abstract: >-
  Anatomy learning has traditionally relied on drawings,
  plastic models, and cadaver dissections/prosections to
  help students understand the three-dimensional (3D)
  relationships within the human body. However, the
  landscape of anatomy education has been transformed with
  the introduction of digital media. In this light, the Open
  Anatomy Explorer (OPANEX) was developed. It includes two
  user interfaces (UI): one for students and one for
  administrators. The administrator UI offers features such
  as uploading and labelling of 3D models, and customizing
  3D settings. Additionally, the OPANEX facilitates content
  sharing between institutes through its import-export
  functionality. To evaluate the integration of OPANEX
  within the existing array of learning resources, a survey
  was conducted as part of the osteology course at Ghent
  University, Belgium. The survey aimed to investigate the
  frequency of use of five learning resources, attitudes
  towards 3D environments, and the OPANEX user experience.
  Analysis revealed that the OPANEX was the most frequently
  used resource. Students' attitudes towards 3D learning
  environments further supported this preference. Feedback
  on the OPANEX user experience indicated various reasons
  for its popularity, including the quality of the models,
  regional annotations, and customized learning content. In
  conclusion, the outcomes underscore the educational value
  of the OPANEX, reflecting students' positive attitudes
  towards 3D environments in anatomy education.
